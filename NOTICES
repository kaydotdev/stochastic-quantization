The following software may be included in this project: NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. This software contains the following license and notice below:

NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit License Agreement
----------------------------------------


Important Notice
----------------

READ CAREFULLY: This Software License Agreement ("Agreement")
for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, including computer software and
associated documentation ("Software"), is the Agreement which
governs use of the SOFTWARE of NVIDIA Corporation and its
subsidiaries ("NVIDIA") downloadable herefrom. By downloading,
installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, You (as
defined below) agree to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement,
do not download the SOFTWARE.


Recitals
--------

Use of NVIDIA's SOFTWARE requires three elements: the
SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or application processor ("NVIDIA
Hardware"), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is protected
by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as
well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The
SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for Your
use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA
Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but
this Agreement does not cover the sale or use of such
hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package
with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and
conditions of the SOFTWARE only.


1.1. Definitions


1.1.1. Licensee

"You", or "Your" shall mean the entity or individual that
downloads and uses the SOFTWARE.


1.1.2. Redistributable Software

"Redistributable Software" shall mean the redistributable
libraries referenced in Attachment A of this Agreement.


1.1.3. Software

"SOFTWARE" shall mean the deliverables provided pursuant to
this Agreement. SOFTWARE may be provided in either source or
binary form, at NVIDIA's discretion.


1.2. Grant of License


1.2.1. Rights and Limitations of Grant

Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this
Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants Licensee the following
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
(except as expressly permitted otherwise for Redistributable
Software in Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3 of this
Agreement) right to use the SOFTWARE -- and, if the SOFTWARE
is provided in source form, to compile the SOFTWARE -- with
the following limitations:


1.2.1.1. Redistribution Rights

Licensee may transfer, redistribute, and sublicense certain
files of the Redistributable SOFTWARE, as defined in
Attachment A of this Agreement, provided, however, that (a)
the Redistributable SOFTWARE shall be distributed solely in
binary form to Licensee's licensees ("Customers") only as a
component of Licensee's own software products (each, a
"Licensee Application"); (b) Licensee shall design the
Licensee Application such that the Redistributable SOFTWARE
files are installed only in a private (non-shared) directory
location that is used only by the Licensee Application; (c)
Licensee shall obtain each Customer's written or clickwrap
agreement to the license terms under a written, legally
enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the
SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less
restrictive than this Agreement.


1.2.1.2. Usage Rights

Licensee may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE
on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,
and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for
Licensee's use within Licensee's Enterprise. "Enterprise"
shall mean individual use by Licensee or any legal entity
(such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it
owns by more than 50 percent.


1.2.1.3. Further Redistribution Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee
may authorize Customers to further redistribute the
Redistributable SOFTWARE that such Customers receive as part
of the Licensee Application, solely in binary form, provided,
however, that Licensee shall require in their standard
software license agreements with Customers that all such
redistributions must be made pursuant to a license agreement
that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights
of NVIDIA whose terms and conditions are at least as
restrictive as those in the applicable Licensee software
license agreement covering the Licensee Application. For
avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall not
affect rights previously granted by Licensee to its Customers
under this Agreement to the extent validly granted to
Customers under Section 1.2.1.1.


1.2.1.4. Linux/FreeBSD Exception

Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 1.2.1.2,
Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3, SOFTWARE designed
exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems,
or other operating systems derived from the source code to
these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed,
provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any
way (except for unzipping of compressed files).


1.2.1.5. Additional Licensing Obligations

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that its use of certain third
party components included with the SOFTWARE may be subject to
additional licensing terms and conditions as set forth or
referenced in Attachment B of this Agreement.


1.2.1.6. Limitations

No Reverse Engineering

If the SOFTWARE is provided in binary form, Licensee may not
reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor
attempt in any other manner to obtain the source code.

No Separation of Components

The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Except as
authorized in this Agreement, Software component parts of the
Software may not be separated for use on more than one
computer, nor otherwise used separately from the other parts.

No Rental

Licensee may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else.

No Modifications

If the SOFTWARE is provided in source form, Licensee may not
modify or create derivative works of the SOFTWARE.


1.3. Term and Termination

This Agreement will continue in effect for two (2) years
("Initial Term") after Your initial download and use of the
SOFTWARE, subject to the exclusive right of NVIDIA to
terminate as provided herein. The term of this Agreement will
automatically renew for successive one (1) year renewal terms
after the Initial Term, unless either party provides to the
other party at least three (3) months prior written notice of
termination before the end of the applicable renewal term.

This Agreement will automatically terminate if Licensee fails
to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such
event, Licensee must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and
all of its component parts.


Defensive Suspension

If Licensee commences or participates in any legal proceeding
against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,
suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights
provided under this Agreement during the pendency of such
legal proceedings.


1.4. Copyright

All rights, title, interest and copyrights in and to the
SOFTWARE (including but not limited to all images,
photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other
information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying
printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned
by NVIDIA, or its suppliers. The SOFTWARE is protected by
copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
Accordingly, Licensee is required to treat the SOFTWARE like
any other copyrighted material, except as otherwise allowed
pursuant to this Agreement and that it may make one copy of
the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archive purposes.

RESTRICTED RIGHTS NOTICE. Software has been developed entirely
at private expense and is commercial computer software
provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Use, duplication or
disclosure by the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government
subcontractor is subject to the restrictions set forth in the
Agreement under which Software was obtained pursuant to DFARS
227.7202-3(a) or as set forth in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2)
of the Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights clause
at FAR 52.227-19, as applicable. Contractor/manufacturer is
NVIDIA, 2701 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95050.


1.5. Applicable Law

This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall
be construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of Delaware.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed. The
courts of Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive
jurisdiction and venue over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement.


1.6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations on Liability


1.6.1. No Warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.


1.6.2. No Liability for Consequential Damages

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL NVIDIA OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,
OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


1.6.3. No Support

NVIDIA has no obligation to support or to provide any updates
of the Software.


1.7. Miscellaneous


1.7.1. Feedback

Notwithstanding any Non-Disclosure Agreement executed by and
between the parties, the parties agree that in the event
Licensee or NVIDIA provides Feedback (as defined below) to the
other party on how to design, implement, or improve the
SOFTWARE or Licensee's product(s) for use with the SOFTWARE,
the following terms and conditions apply the Feedback:


1.7.1.1. Exchange of Feedback

Both parties agree that neither party has an obligation to
give the other party any suggestions, comments or other
feedback, whether verbally or in written or source code form,
relating to (i) the SOFTWARE; (ii) Licensee's products; (iii)
Licensee's use of the SOFTWARE; or (iv)
optimization/interoperability of Licensee's product with the
SOFTWARE (collectively defined as "Feedback"). In the event
either party provides Feedback to the other party, the party
receiving the Feedback may use any Feedback that the other
party voluntarily provides to improve the (i) SOFTWARE or
other related NVIDIA technologies, respectively for the
benefit of NVIDIA; or (ii) Licensee's product or other related
Licensee technologies, respectively for the benefit of
Licensee. Accordingly, if either party provides Feedback to
the other party, both parties agree that the other party and
its respective licensees may freely use, reproduce, license,
distribute, and otherwise commercialize the Feedback in the
(i) SOFTWARE or other related technologies; or (ii) Licensee's
products or other related technologies, respectively, without
the payment of any royalties or fees.


1.7.1.2. Residual Rights

Licensee agrees that NVIDIA shall be free to use any general
knowledge, skills and experience, (including, but not limited
to, ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques) ("Residuals"),
contained in the (i) Feedback provided by Licensee to NVIDIA;
(ii) Licensee's products shared or disclosed to NVIDIA in
connection with the Feedback; or (c) Licensee's confidential
information voluntarily provided to NVIDIA in connection with
the Feedback, which are retained in the memories of NVIDIA's
employees, agents, or contractors who have had access to such
Residuals. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, NVIDIA's employees, agents, or contractors shall
not be prevented from using Residuals as part of such
employee's, agent's or contractor's general knowledge, skills,
experience, talent, and/or expertise. NVIDIA shall not have
any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such
employees, agents or contractors or to pay royalties for any
work resulting from the use of Residuals.


1.7.1.3. Disclaimer of Warranty

FEEDBACK FROM EITHER PARTY IS PROVIDED FOR THE OTHER PARTY'S
USE "AS IS" AND BOTH PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. BOTH PARTIES DO NOT
REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE FEEDBACK WILL MEET THE OTHER
PARTY'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OR IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE FEEDBACK WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.


1.7.1.4. No Liability for Consequential Damages

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,
OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE FEEDBACK, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


1.7.2. Freedom of Action

Licensee agrees that this Agreement is nonexclusive and NVIDIA
may currently or in the future be developing software, other
technology or confidential information internally, or
receiving confidential information from other parties that
maybe similar to the Feedback and Licensee's confidential
information (as provided in Section 1.7.1.2 above), which may
be provided to NVIDIA in connection with Feedback by Licensee.
Accordingly, Licensee agrees that nothing in this Agreement
will be construed as a representation or inference that NVIDIA
will not develop, design, manufacture, acquire, market
products, or have products developed, designed, manufactured,
acquired, or marketed for NVIDIA, that compete with the
Licensee's products or confidential information.


1.7.3. No Implied Licenses

Under no circumstances should anything in this Agreement be
construed as NVIDIA granting by implication, estoppel or
otherwise, (i) a license to any NVIDIA product or technology
other than the SOFTWARE; or (ii) any additional license rights
for the SOFTWARE other than the licenses expressly granted in
this Agreement.


1.7.4.

If any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with, or
cannot be fully enforced under, the law, such provision will
be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be
consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This
Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement
between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and
agreements relating to such subject matter, whether oral or
written. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed
by an authorized officer of NVIDIA. Licensee agrees that it
will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any
country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the
United States Bureau of Industry and Security or any export
laws, restrictions or regulations.


1.7.5.

    ------------
    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

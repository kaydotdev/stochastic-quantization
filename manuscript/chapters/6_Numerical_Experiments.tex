\section{Numerical Experiments}

TODO: To create software implementation of Triplet Network we used PyTorch package \cite{Ansel_2024}, Stochastic Quantizaton Algorithm was implemented using Scikit-learn \cite{Pedregosa_2011} and Numpy \cite{harris2020array} packages. All visualization was performed using Matplotlib package \cite{Hunter_2007}.
